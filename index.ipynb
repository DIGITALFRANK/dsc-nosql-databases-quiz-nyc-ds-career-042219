    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",

    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",

    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is conceptual approach to querying and aggragating data that is employed by Hadoop.  MapReduce is ideal for working with distributed datasets, and greatly reduces querying times when working with Big Data.  The Map phase allows queries to run individually in parrallel on RDDs or smaller block of the data in the distributed system.  The Reduce phase then combines the results from these queries and returns the final output\n",
